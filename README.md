### Network Topology
<<<<<<< HEAD:README-p3.md
=======

>>>>>>> 255c010a583e14ffa2eca9718dbfc6f9c172ab02:README.md
The following machines were identified on the network:
- Name of VM 1
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Wordpress Server
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.110
- Name of VM 2
  - **Operating System**: Kali
  - **Purpose**: Attacker Machine
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.90

### Description of Targets

The target of this attack was: 192.168.1.110.

Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

### Monitoring the Targets

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

#### Excessive HTTP Errors

Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Packetbeat
  - **Threshold**: Grouped over 5 and above 400 for the last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**:  BruteForce 
  - **Reliability**:  Medium-High Reliability. Alert catches enumeration,Â  but not stealth or throttling.

#### CPU Usage Monitor
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Metricbeat
  - **Threshold**: When max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct Overa all documents IS ABOVE -.5 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Local Enumeration
  - **Reliability**:  Reliable as it is based upon the baseline of CPU usage for the internal . High reliability of target 1

#### HTTP Request Size Monitor
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Metricbeat
  - **Threshold**: WHEN sum() OF http.request.bytes OVER all documents IS ABOVE 3500 FOR THE LAST 1 minute 
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Collective byte for documents. Exploits and Enumeration. 
  - **Reliability**: Threshold is too high to catch meterpreter shells. Low reliability and we see this later.

## Table of Contents
- Exposed Services
- Critical Vulnerabilities
- Exploitation

### Exposed Services

Nmap scan results for each machine reveal the below services and OS details:

```bash
$ nmap ... # TODO: Add command to Scan Target 1
nmap -sC -sV -A -p- 192.168.1.110
  # TODO: Insert scan output
```

This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:

# Network Forensic Analysis Report

At least two users on the network have been wasting time on YouTube. Usually, IT wouldn't pay much mind to this behavior, but it seems these people have created their own web server on the corporate network. So far, Security knows the following about these time thieves:

-   They have set up an Active Directory network.
-   They are constantly watching videos on YouTube.
-   Their IP addresses are somewhere in the range `10.6.12.0/24`.

## Time Thieves 

1. Custom Domain alias: 
		- Frank-n-Ted.com
2.  IP address of the Domain Controller (DC) of the AD network? 
		- 10.6.12.12	
![kerberos](images/kerberos.png)

3.  Name of the malware downloaded to the 10.6.12.203 machine:
		-June11.dll
4. Upload the file to [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/). 
5. Malware Classification:
		- Trojan Horse
